## **DAY 21 (9 Oct 2023):**
### Topic: Advanced Scikit-Learn Features

Key Takeaways:
- sklearn.metrics Module: This enables you to get all the metrics to evaluate your model, and we can also display confusion matrix with ConfusionMatrixDisplay method.

- sklearn.compose Module: This module allows us to create complex transformations and feature engineering pipelines efficiently. It's a game-changer when dealing with intricate data preprocessing tasks.

- sklearn.pipeline Module: Pipelines help streamline the ML workflow. They ensure a consistent sequence of data transformations and model fitting. The Pipeline class combines multiple steps into one.

- One-Hot Encoding: An essential preprocessing technique for categorical data. It converts categorical variables into a binary matrix, making them suitable for ML models.

- ColumnTransformer: This enables you to apply different preprocessing steps to specific subsets of your dataset. For instance, you can preprocess numerical and categorical features separately and combine them seamlessly.

- Feature Unions: You can combine the outputs of multiple transformer objects into a single transformer using FeatureUnion. This is useful when you have different types of data (e.g., text and numerical) and want to process them separately and then concatenate the results.
And many more..
