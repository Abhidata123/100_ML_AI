<h1 align="center">100 Days Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h1>

## How it Started? Day 0 - 18 Sept 2023
Over the past months, I've dived into the world of data science, mastering tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Now, I'm ready to take my skills to the next level!

This 100-day journey will be all about understanding statistics, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms at their core, along with a lot of hands-on projects. I'm eager to delve deep into the theory behind these powerful algorithms, ensuring I grasp every concept intricately. But there's a twist!

Throughout this challenge, I'll be sharing my newfound insights with our amazing community. Each day, I'll revisit these topics and **create articles to teach what I've learned.** You can [Follow me on Medium](https://medium.com/@tejag311) for Detailed Articles. My goal is simple: to enhance my own understanding while helping others on their data science journeys. 

## What Inspired Me?
One of the things is definitely the “Show Your Work” book by Austin Kleon, and I believe it can motivate you as well. Read [more about it here.](https://medium.com/@tejag311/100-days-of-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-challenge-5fae5f6cfec5)
