## **DAY 15 (3 Oct 2023):**
### Topic: Probability for Data Science

1. Probability Basics: Understand the fundamental concepts like events, outcomes, and sample spaces.
2. Probability Formulas: Master key formulas:
    - Probability of an Event (P(A)): Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes.
    - Conditional Probability (P(A|B)): Probability of A given that B has occurred.
    - Bayes' Theorem: A powerful tool for updating probabilities based on new evidence.
    - Law of Large Numbers: As you increase the sample size, the sample mean converges to the population mean. Crucial for statistical inference.
3. Probability Distributions: Get acquainted with probability distributions:
    - Normal Distribution: The bell curve is everywhere in data science. It's essential for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
    - Bernoulli Distribution: For binary outcomes (like success or failure).
    - Binomial Distribution: When dealing with a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
    - Poisson Distribution: Used for rare events, like customer arrivals at a store.
