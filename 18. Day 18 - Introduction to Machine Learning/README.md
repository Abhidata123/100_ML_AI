### Topic: Introduction to Machine Learning

- What is Machine Learning?
Simply put, Machine Learning is a technique to teach a computer program to progressively improve on a task by itself by finding patterns in the given data.

- Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning each input is paired with a corresponding correct output. Show a few of these 🍎 shapes to the machine and you say the label of them as apple, now it learn that and next time you show 🍎 , it says "apple".
Example: Predicting house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.

- Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the algorithm must find patterns or structures on its own. This time you just show different shapes to it 🍎 🍍 🍎 🍍 , without any labels. It learns the pattern and segregates them into groups 🍎 🍎,🍍🍍. Next time you show 🍍 It will predict the group which is similar to it.
Example: Clustering similar customer profiles based on their behavior.

- In Reinforcement learning, there is no particular labeled input or labeled output, all it has is the main data, like trial and error method, It involves reward-based learning, where it learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
Example: Training a robot to navigate a maze by rewarding it for reaching the goal.

- Semi-supervised learning combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
