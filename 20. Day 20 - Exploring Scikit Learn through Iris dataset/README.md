## **DAY 20 (8 Oct 2023):**
### Topic: Exploring Scikit-Learn

ðŸ“š Key Scikit-learn Modules:
- sklearn.datasets: A module for loading and working with datasets, including built-in datasets.
- sklearn.preprocessing: Contains utilities for data preprocessing such as scaling, encoding, and imputation.
- sklearn.model_selection: For splitting data into training and testing sets, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- sklearn.feature_selection: Provides methods to select the most relevant features for your models.
- sklearn.metrics: Provides various metrics to evaluate model performance, including confusion_matrix.
- sklearn.linear_model: Contains Linear Models, including Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
- sklearn.tree and sklearn.ensemble: Modules for Decision Trees, Random Forests, and ensemble methods.
- sklearn.cluster: For clustering algorithms like K-Means and hierarchical clustering.
-  sklearn.neighbors: For k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms.
And Many more...


ðŸ’¡ Key Methods in Scikit-learn:
- fit(): This method trains the model on the given dataset.
- predict(): Generates predictions on new data samples.
- transform(): Applies feature transformations.
- score(): Evaluates model performance using an appropriate metric.
- GridSearchCV(): Conducts a grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
